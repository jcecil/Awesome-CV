\lettersection{About Me}
Recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Missouri, St. Louis. Seeking an entry-level position in Software Engineering where my strong problem solving skills and CS background will be well utilized. Determined and self-motivated, my temporary work experience in retail and customer service roles provide a good basis for effectively communicating with others in a small team, regardless of technical background. A quick learner who is looking for the right opportunity to prove himself.
